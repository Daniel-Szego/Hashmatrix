# Hashmatrix
Experimental implementation of a multi-hash Blockchain network

Cryptography: 
 - Elliptic Curve Cryptography for signing transactions
 - SHA-256 for hash pointers between hashed
 
 State:
 - Extended account/balance based system 
 - Each account has a balance that can be transferred from
 - Each account has a data that can be modified
 - Each account has a nonce, to prevent replay attack
 - Account controlled by public-private keys generated by elipcit curve crypto
 - Account address is the public key
 - Account owner is the private key
 - Accounts are added to the chain indirectly, as they are referred by the transactions
 
 Transactions:
 - Two kind of a transactions
 - Transferring money from balance to balance, signed by the from account private key
 - Setting new data value signed by the private key of the account
 - Transaction nonce must be higher by one as the account nonce
 
Wallet:
 - Random wallet controlling accounts
 - New accounts can be generated by the wallet
 - Not syncronized with the chain automatically, only if transactions was initialized on that account

Communication protocols: 
 - getting peers -> only one round
 - propagating transactions -> only one hop: only in fully connected networks
 - propagating blocks -> only one hop: only in fully connected networks
 
 Mining: 
  - Proof of work miner
  - Fork resolving policy: longest chain
